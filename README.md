# Emoji Annotations

Unicode [CLDR emoji annotations][annotations] exposed in an easy to use dictionary.

**NOTE:** This is not an emoji search tool. For going from text to emoji check out [muan/emojilib](https://github.com/muan/emojilib).

## Why

The iOS emoji keyboard is not very user friendly. It's much simpler to input emoji by typing their associated annotation in your language, assuming you know the relevant annotation.

Therefore this library is mainly a learning tool. Once you know how to get to an emoji using your keyboard of choice, there's no need to look it up again.

## What else?

**Why does this work?**

A: According to the CLDR website these annotations are [used by many large companies including Apple and Google](http://cldr.unicode.org/#TOC-Who-uses-CLDR-).
